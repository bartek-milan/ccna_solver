## Features

- **OCR-based screen capture**: Detects questions from your test window.  
- **Automated search**: Queries DuckDuckGo for the top result from `itexamanswers.net`.  
- **On-screen overlays**: Highlights the correct answers with small, semi-transparent dots.  
- **Hotkey-driven workflow**: Simple keypresses to trigger search, display answers, or quit instantly.  

> ⚠️ Note: Image-based exercises are currently **not supported**.

## Usage

1. Open your CCNA test or exercise on your screen.  
2. Run the `ccna_solver.exe`.  
3. Use the hotkeys to interact with the program:  

   **Recommended workflow**:  
   1. **NUM 1** → Search for the answer  
   2. **NUM 2** → Show the correct answers on-screen  

4. The software runs mostly invisibly; the only visible indicators are the small overlay dots marking answers.
